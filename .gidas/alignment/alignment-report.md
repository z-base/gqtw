# Alignment Report

## Status
- COMPLETED: preconditions, deterministic indexes, cross-spec map, and alignment plan generated from local working trees.

## Alignment Focus Applied
- Wallet-private artifacts (`proof artifact`, binding credentials, VC claims) are treated as private and GDIS-owned concepts.
- Trust-public verification material (`verification material`, DID docs, key history) is treated as GQTS-owned publication state.
- GQTS log semantics are modeled as an append-only signed chain with bad-node conflict signaling.

## What Changed
- Read AGENTS.md and gidas-alignment.config.json preconditions.
- Generated spec-index.self.json for GQTW-CORE.
- Generated `spec-index.peers.json` for configured peer snapshots.
- Generated `cross-spec-map.json` with canonical ownership, new conflict classes, and gaps.
- Generated `alignment-plan.md` with SELF-specific edits and UNSPECIFIED items.
- Generated `codex-alignment-prompt.template.txt` ready to copy into peer repos.

## Duplicates Removed
- none detected in this generation step.

## Cross-References Added
- no spec text edits were applied by this generator; cross-reference actions are listed in `alignment-plan.md`.
