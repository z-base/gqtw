## Required Changes In SELF (GQTW-CORE)
- No non-canonical local term definitions detected in SELF snapshot.
- Explicitly state that wallet proof artifacts/claims remain private and are not stored by trust services.
- Keep GDIS credential issuance semantics, but leave publication mechanics for private artifacts as UNSPECIFIED.
- Ensure any GQTS-hosted OpenAPI operations use canonical requirement IDs and schema-equivalent Proof/DID document structures.
- Ensure each requirement ID has a stable anchor or explicit alias anchor.

## UNSPECIFIED
- OPRF/BBS profile details and blinded/unblinded flow details remain UNSPECIFIED unless separately profiled.
- Bad-node handling policy details beyond detect/flag/reject are UNSPECIFIED.
- Cross-repo peer edits are out of scope for this repo and remain UNSPECIFIED in this run.
